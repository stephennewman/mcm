              <p className="text-gray-800">
                We are witnessing a monumental paradigm shift in how people find information, evaluate solutions, and make decisions. Search engines will soon no longer be the dominant online force—they're being slowly replaced by AI in user behavior. Traditional websites are exhausting users. AI is the emerging channel—and marketers must adapt now or become irrelevant.
              </p>
            </div>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">The Monumental Power of AI (Often Misunderstood)</h2>
            <p>
              We've all been exposed to the capabilities of AI. It's often misunderstood—even by those who built it. But there's no denying there's a massive shift happening right now in terms of engagement, marketing, sales, technology. How people find tools. How they solve problems.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>The old ways of finding information are no longer relevant.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              You don't look up a plumber in the Yellow Pages anymore. That's an outdated channel. Granted, you might go there to verify information—trust but verify—but that's not where you <em>find</em> information. Traditional forms of advertising don't really work anymore.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">Bold Claim #1: Search Engines Are Losing Dominance</h2>
            <p>
              The bold claim we're making—which is yet to be proven unequivocally, but we feel will be proven in the next 10 years—is this:
            </p>
            <div className="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-600 p-6 rounded text-xl font-semibold">
              Search engines will no longer be the dominant force online. They're being slowly replaced by AI in user behavior patterns.
            </div>
            <p>
              <strong>Why are they losing dominance?</strong>
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>They were built on infrastructure optimized for a different era.</li>
              <li>The value extraction model has reached its peak.</li>
              <li>Companies like Google have monetized every conceivable angle.</li>
              <li><strong>They have too much friction.</strong> Too many clicks. Too much consumption. Society doesn't have time for that.</li>
              <li><strong>AI provides a better user experience</strong> for many types of queries—instant answers without clicking through 10 links.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">Bold Claim #2: Website Fatigue</h2>
            <p>
              People are sick of websites. They've been around for a long time. <strong>Users just want to know:</strong>
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>What do you got?</li>
              <li>How much does it cost?</li>
              <li>Can I use it?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              I don't need to scroll through 500 pages. I don't need to go through the traditional buyer journey. I don't need to download a piece of content and educate myself. <strong>We live in an instant gratification world.</strong>
            </p>
            <div className="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-600 p-6 rounded">
              <p className="font-semibold mb-2">Websites should be tight.</p>
              <p>I don't need 900 pages and a big long navigation. I don't need all that stuff. I just need to know: <strong>Can you do the job or not? Can you provide the information or not?</strong></p>
            </div>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">Enter ChatGPT and AI Models: Still in Infancy</h2>
            <p>
              Here comes ChatGPT. Here come all the AI models. We're still in the infancy in terms of how we use this stuff. Some of us recognize the power and capabilities that are coming.
            </p>
            <p>
              ChatGPT scaled to <strong>over 1 billion users in 36 months.</strong> Insane.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-3">The Bell Curve of AI User Capabilities</h3>
            <p>
              One of the biggest epiphanies I had about AI early on: I showed it to my parents, my sister, and my dad. I had been using AI to do all sorts of crazy stuff, learning and sharpening my skills.
            </p>
            <p>
              And they asked one of the most basic questions: <strong>"What's the weather like today?"</strong>
            </p>
            <p className="italic">
              You're sitting here engaging with the most powerful technological advancement in the history of mankind, and the best thing you can come up with is "What's the weather like today?" You're sitting outside.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>What this means:</strong> There's an entire spectrum. A bell curve in terms of user capabilities. You've got your power users. Then you've got early adopters that aren't quite there yet.
            </p>
            <p>
              But as the market starts to learn and understand—as consumers start to learn how to use these tools effectively—they will start using them more and more for bigger problems. Problems that you can solve.
            </p>
            <div className="bg-green-50 border-l-4 border-green-600 p-6 rounded">
              <p className="font-semibold mb-2">Critical Insight</p>
              <p>They're going to use AI in ways that help them evaluate solutions to problems you can solve. You've got to structure your methods of communication to AI in a way that enables AI to properly articulate back to users how your company, how your product, how your brand is best suited to solve those problems.</p>
            </div>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">The Bet Marketers Must Make</h2>
            <p>
              For marketing teams, the bet you're making right now is:
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl font-semibold">
              Do I want to invest time, effort, energy, money into traditional channels like search and social? Or do I want to invest into emerging channels like AI?
            </p>
            <p>
              AI—although there are hundreds of millions of users—is still an emerging channel. The method of consumption is still the screen, but <strong>what's behind the screen is wildly different.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Think about televisions. They've been around for quite some time. How we view TVs has changed dramatically. The undercurrent of simplification is always there. Consumer mindsets shift. Cable is on the chopping block. Subscription-based packages curated to the consumer have emerged.
            </p>
            <p className="font-semibold text-lg">
              You've got to adapt.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">How AI Evaluates Brands: Trust</h2>
            <p>
              When we talk about AI as a channel, you have to make a bet. You have to signal to AI that you are the type of brand, the type of company that can be trusted.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>That's how AI is going to evaluate brands: based on trust.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              AI evaluated brands historically based on a lot of web crawling, scraping, searching, verifying, sourcing. They trained all their data on the internet. They took their best guess.
            </p>
            <p>
              But the next wave of AI-generated training and content that AI is going to consume—in terms of relevance for the end user—<strong>is not going to come from traditional methods.</strong> It shouldn't come from traditional websites, because traditional websites were not built to communicate properly to AI models.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">Your Best Salesperson Is AI</h2>
            <div className="bg-purple-50 border-l-4 border-purple-600 p-6 rounded text-lg">
              <p className="font-semibold mb-2">People will start to trust AI models:</p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
                <li>More than Google</li>
                <li>More than a slick salesperson</li>
                <li>More than their neighbor (maybe)</li>
                <li>Maybe the only people they won't trust more are colleagues</li>
              </ul>
              <p className="mt-3">In the digital world, <strong>AI is your best salesperson.</strong></p>
            </div>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">The Problem: Marketers Don't Know How to Engage AI</h2>
            <p>
              There's a lot of problems for marketers now. It's a big black box. Marketers don't know how to engage with these models properly and consistently to where they can get repeatable results.
            </p>
            <p>
              As always, they've got an executive breathing down their neck: <em>"Where's my results?"</em>
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-3">Product-Marketing Alignment (Not Sales-Marketing)</h3>
            <p>
              What marketers have to do: <strong>You have to be pushing and getting aligned with product. Not sales. Product.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              You've got to get aligned with product. You have to be in alignment with product so it enables product to <strong>reduce the friction</strong> for customers to sign up and start using your products.
            </p>
            <p>
              All the offers that historically have done well? They're not going to do well in the era of AI.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">The Content Problem: Everyone's Asking AI the Same Thing</h2>
            <p>
              Here's the problem. Line up 50 brands. Say, "Hey, I need you to create content on project management." There's 50 marketing teams.
            </p>
            <p>
              They're all going to go to ChatGPT and ask it to write article after article about project management.
            </p>
            <p>
              And then AI is going to look at all 50 brands and say:
            </p>
            <div className="bg-gray-100 border-l-4 border-gray-600 p-6 rounded italic text-lg">
              "Well, I created all this stuff. So what do you know? What do you know? What do you know? None of you are giving me anything useful."
            </div>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-3">The Underwater Basket Weaving Analogy</h3>
            <p>
              Think about it this way:
            </p>
            <p>
              Take something you know better than your friends and family. Let's call it underwater basket weaving. I'm the world's expert. I know everything there is to know about it.
            </p>
            <p>
              I sit 10 people down. I teach them about underwater basket weaving. I offer up information for free. I'll generate content about this topic for free that I can give back to you.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now, 9 of those people ask me for my insights and generate articles about underwater basket weaving using what I told them.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>How do you think I'm going to view those 9 articles?</strong> Pretty poorly, right? Where did that information come from? It came from me. It came from all the sources of content creators from a prior era.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>But then there's the 10th person.</strong>
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">The Untapped Source: Domain Experts</h2>
            <p>
              That 10th person decides to do something different. Instead of asking me what I know about underwater basket weaving, they go to their network. They have their people—their colleagues, their connections—provide them with <strong>new information. Authentic information. Well-curated and organized information</strong> about underwater basket weaving.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the end of the contest, I look at 9 people who have given me the same crap I already knew—the crap I already extracted in formats that were basically kind of old.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then I've got this 10th one that comes to me with:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 font-semibold">
              <li>New information</li>
              <li>Organized information</li>
              <li>Better information</li>
            </ul>
            <div className="bg-green-50 border-l-4 border-green-600 p-6 rounded text-lg">
              <p className="font-semibold mb-2">They might not be the best at underwater basket weaving.</p>
              <p>But they are the one that I can trust. I can trust them more because <strong>they're communicating with me in a way that I want to be communicated with.</strong></p>
            </div>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-3">Domain Sourcing (Not Crowdsourcing, Not Thought Leadership)</h3>
            <p>
              The untapped sources of content are <strong>the domain experts</strong> who have stayed out of the public domain.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is not thought leadership. Thought leadership was a term used in the early 2000s, 2010s, where a handful of people had forward-thinking ideas. That doesn't matter anymore.
            </p>
            <p>
              It's not crowdsourcing either.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl font-semibold">
              It's domain sourcing.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>What is your domain? What do you know about? Can you articulate it in a way that's interesting and different, but also in a way that AI can understand?</strong> So AI can put you near the top.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">The Solution: Voice-Based Domain Extraction</h2>
            <p>
              You have to communicate the right way. You have to structure it the right way. You have to get information from your people in a simple and effective way.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl font-semibold">
              How do you do that? Through voice.
            </p>
            <div className="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-600 p-6 rounded">
              <p className="font-semibold mb-2">Voice-Based Content Extraction</p>
              <p>You need to be communicating and interviewing your employees and extracting value. They can be anonymous. They can be public-facing. But you have got to get that information out of them to be relevant in this next era of AI.</p>
              <p className="mt-2">You've got to leverage internal domain expertise.</p>
            </div>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">The Future: AI-Optimized Search (AIS)</h2>
            <p>
              It used to be SSO (single sign-on). That's still viable. But there's a new acronym coming—something like <strong>AIS (AI-Integrated Search)</strong>—some way to quickly add your brand to users' boards of topics and tools.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>It's almost inevitable:</strong> There's going to be a paid element for search queries and citing of sources.
            </p>
            <p>
              When somebody says, "Can you tell me about underwater basket weaving?" AI will list out sources. It's going to do some bidding. It won't go to Google first and ask who's number one.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">Stay Ahead of the Game</h2>
            <p>
              You plug in. You're going to get instant value—even if you don't see instant results. That could just mean you're not ready yet. If you're already getting some results from it, great.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl font-semibold">
              But you've got to stay ahead of the game.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-3">It's a Race (Not a Race to the Bottom)</h3>
            <p>
              Some might say it's a race to the bottom. I used to think that way. But I don't think it's a race to the bottom because that would assume there's an end.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>I think it's supply and demand. Survival of the fittest.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              If you can run faster and further and provide more value, people will pay for that. If you can provide less friction, people will pay for that.
            </p>
            <div className="bg-yellow-50 border-l-4 border-yellow-600 p-6 rounded text-lg font-semibold">
              I don't think it's a race to the bottom. I think it's just a race.

            <p>
              We're going through a transformation. It's an evolution of merging channels. We're in an era where everything is changing.
