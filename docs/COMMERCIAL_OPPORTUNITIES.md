## 🚀 The Play

**You created a new discipline.** You're the authority. Now monetize that authority through:

1. **Products** (SaaS tools that others can't easily replicate)
2. **Education** (certification that only you can issue)
3. **Services** (high-touch implementation for premium clients)
4. **Community** (network effects and recurring revenue)

Start with services (immediate cash flow), build the analyzer (demonstrates expertise), launch certification (passive income), then expand to platform (scale through agencies).

**This is a $5M-$10M ARR business within 3 years if executed well.**

The market is everyone doing digital marketing. The timing is perfect (LLMs are exploding). The competition is zero (you invented this).

**Now go build it.** 🚀
