# AI Onboarding - Model Context Marketing

## Project Overview
**Model Context Marketing** is an educational website focused on helping marketers create content and structure websites that large language models (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, DeepSeek, Google, etc.) can understand and recommend.

## Purpose
- Help marketers understand how LLMs work
- Provide frameworks for creating factual, research-based content that LLMs prefer
- Move away from traditional marketing "hype" toward domain expertise and authority
- Position brands to be recommended when users ask LLMs for solutions

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 16 (App Router)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4
- **Deployment**: Vercel (planned)
- **Package Manager**: npm

## Current Status
✅ Initial setup complete
✅ Bare minimum site structure
✅ Server-side rendering enabled (all content visible to crawlers)
✅ SEO infrastructure in place

## Key Directories
```
/app
  - page.tsx          # Homepage with core content
  - layout.tsx        # Root layout with metadata
  - globals.css       # Global styles
  - robots.ts         # Robots.txt for crawler access
  - sitemap.ts        # XML sitemap
/public              # Static assets
```

## Content Strategy
- Content will be created from voice memo transcripts
- No traditional "blog" format - exploring versioned/documentation-style approach
- Focus on factual, authoritative information
- All content optimized for LLM understanding and citation

## SEO & LLM Optimization Features Implemented
✅ Server-side rendering (no client-side JS rendering issues)
✅ robots.txt - explicitly allows ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Google-Extended, and all crawlers
✅ sitemap.xml - dynamic sitemap generation
✅ Canonical URLs - prevent duplicate content issues
✅ Enhanced Metadata:
  - Open Graph tags
  - Twitter Card tags
  - Structured keywords
  - Author/publisher information
✅ JSON-LD Structured Data (Schema.org):
  - WebSite schema
  - Article schema
  - Author/publisher markup
✅ Semantic HTML structure

## Development Commands
```bash
npm install          # Install dependencies
npm run dev         # Start dev server (http://localhost:3000)
npm run build       # Build for production
npm start           # Start production server
npm run lint        # Run linter
```

## Recent Activity Log

### 2025-11-04 - Messaging Refinement: Search Engine Dominance (9:00 PM)
**Content Updates:**
- ✅ **Refined "Search Engines Dying" Narrative** - More nuanced, accurate positioning
  - Changed from "search engines are dying/dead/obsolete" to "losing dominance as primary force"
  - Positioned search engines as transitioning from discovery tools to verification tools
  - Emphasized coexistence strategy: continue SEO AND invest in AI optimization (not either/or)
  - Updated across: AI Channel memo, Search Engine Decay concept, homepage, FAQ (3 questions)
- ✅ **Strategic Positioning Shift**
  - Old message: "Choose AI over SEO"
  - New message: "Do both—search still matters, but diversify into AI now"
  - More realistic, defensible, and actionable for marketers

**Philosophy:**
- Avoid hyperbole that can be easily disproven
- Search engines won't disappear—they'll become secondary
- AI adoption is accelerating but not replacing search overnight
- Winners will optimize for both channels

  - 9 different scoring algorithms tailored to each model's known preferences
- ✅ **Rate Limiting** (`lib/rate-limiter.ts`)
  - In-memory IP tracking
  - 10 requests/hour window
  - Returns 429 status when exceeded
- ✅ **Environment Validation** (`lib/validate-env.ts`)
